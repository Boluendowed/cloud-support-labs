# cloud-support-labs (AWS)

This is my Cloud Support / Cloud Operations hub: runbooks, incident reports (RCA), troubleshooting checklists, and automation scripts.

## What’s inside
- **/runbooks** — step-by-step operational guides (what to check first, commands, expected output)
- **/incident-reports** — RCA template + sample incident writeups
- **/scripts** — quick evidence collection (CPU/disk/memory/log tails, service status)
- **/diagrams** — simple architecture sketches for each lab
- **/docs** — onboarding + troubleshooting checklists

## How to use this repo
Pick a scenario (CPU spike, instance unreachable, 5xx errors), follow the runbook, then compare to the incident report writeups.
